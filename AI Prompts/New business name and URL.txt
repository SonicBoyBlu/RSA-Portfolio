Please suggest some business names with available ".com" domain registrations from GoDadd.com for a small business consortium/collective focused on helping setup small businesses, LLCs, and independent contractors that offer help from initial startup to in-flight advice and how to grow their business.  It should be short and memorable, easy to understand when heard in a busy area such as a bar, restaurant, or airport. it should be catchy but not overly kitchy.  Please give me some business name options, a potential URL, and a potential tagline.

I don't really like any of these names.  Rerun this query, but with results more edgy yet memorable.  The names don't need to be verbose, so think of adjectives that encompass small business needs, advice, marketing, logistics, startup, support, marketplace, consortium, and other relevant verticals.
